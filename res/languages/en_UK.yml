Create a new depot by looking at a chest and using &f/depot new <ID> [distance=1]&x.\n
Chests adjacent to it are included. To get chests slightly out of range, increase the distance.\n
To get another group of chests, use &f/depot update <ID> [distance=1] [sub/ADD]&x.\n
If chests are included that you don't want to, use &fSUB&x to subtract chests from the depot.\n
You can use a distance of &f0&x to get exactly one chest, or chest part.\n
